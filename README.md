# Code-Refractor-Horiseon
Used the Scout Rule to Refractor the code provided for the company Horiseon. Worked on all links and made sure they are functioning correctly. I attempted to clean up the CSS to make it more user friendly. I followed the semantic structure of the HTML elements and included comments before each element or section of the page.
